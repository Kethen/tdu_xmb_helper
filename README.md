## TDU xmb helper

Implemented mostly following the description at https://github.com/djey47/tduf-next/tree/master/doc/RE/xmb

Dumps data and their offsets to help editing using hex editors

A way better dedicated xmb editor seem to already exists somewhere, ask around before trying to use this

### Build
